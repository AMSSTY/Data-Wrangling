Introduction

This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and/or SQL. The dataset that you will be wrangling is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. Because «they're good dogs Brent.» WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

What Software Do I Need?

The entirety of this project can be completed inside the Udacity classroom on the Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project page using the Jupyter Notebook provided there. (Note: This Project Workspace may not be available in all versions of this project, in which case you should follow the directions below.)
